This is a custom installer for composer packages.

To use it, add this repository and require 'hubzero/extension-installer'
before requiring your HUBzero extension package.

As a HUBzero extension developer, you should set `type` to one of 
`hubzero-component`, `hubzero-plugin`, `hubzero-module`, or `hubzero-template`
in your composer.json file.
